# Forza Horizon 5 Afking v2

After patch which stops earning Skill points after few minutes, I will share my new method to afking in Forza Horizon 5 for KarmaDriving's AFK blueprints. Check his channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeC3DI53zmQZPuQZ5iZhmkg

# Setup

First, you need to change the difficulty to the following

- Braking: Assisted
- Steering: Auto-Steering
- Traction control: ON
- Stability control: ON

Download [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and my AHK script

What the script is doing is to hold a W key for 60 seconds, release for 1 second and hold for 60 seconds. It's a loop. As simple as that. You can edit the .ahk script using any text editor and change key if you want to

Run the script, it will run in the background and press "1" key to hold the key. Press 2 to exit the script

#### Xbox Cloud Gaming

I recommended to use the browser version https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play. Doesn't matter what browser you are using

Use [Keyboard & Mouse for Xbox xCloud](https://idolize.github.io/xcloud-keyboard-mouse/) browser entension, or [Xbox 360 Controller Emulator](https://www.x360ce.com/). and map the keys you like to

#### Multitasking

Vmware and Virtualbox does not support Directx 12. Maybe Hyper-V support DirectX 12 with GPU passthrough but i'm not sure. Currently there is no known ways to run this game in VM

If you have Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can use that and run the AHK script inside VM, and enjoy multitasking!

# Is it bannable?

No, driving assisting is a feature, not an exploit, and it propably doesn't detect running 3rd party softwares

# It takes the fun away!!!

Who cares? It's entirely up to you how you are playing, whether you want to be lazy ass, or play properly as intended. Go away if you don't like it
